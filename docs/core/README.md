# AI Runtime Security - Core

Reducing harm caused by AI systems in production through risk-proportionate controls that you select, adapt, or consciously deselect based on your risk appetite and the way your organisation works.

!!! info "About this section"
    This is the implementation companion to the Foundation overview. The Foundation explains the architecture and principles. This section contains the risk classification criteria, control definitions, checklists, and specialised controls you need to implement them. Start with the essentials. Branch into specialised topics based on your deployment. Deselect what does not apply.

## Reading Order

Start with the essentials, then branch into specialised topics based on your deployment:

**Essential (read in order):**
1. [Risk Tiers](risk-tiers.md) - classify your system
2. [Risk Assessment](risk-assessment.md) - quantify control effectiveness and residual risk per tier
3. [Controls](controls.md) - implement the three-layer pattern
4. [Agentic](agentic.md) - add controls if your agent has tool access
5. [IAM Governance](iam-governance.md) - identity, lifecycle, delegation
6. [Judge Assurance](judge-assurance.md) - measure and calibrate the Judge
7. [Checklist](checklist.md) - track implementation progress

**Specialised (read based on your deployment type):**

| If you're deploying... | Read |
|---|---|
| Multimodal models (image, audio, video) | [Multimodal Controls](multimodal-controls.md) |
| Reasoning models (chain-of-thought) | [Reasoning Model Controls](reasoning-model-controls.md) |
| Streaming responses | [Streaming Controls](streaming-controls.md) |
| Persistent memory or long context | [Memory and Context](memory-and-context.md) |
| Multi-agent systems | [Multi-Agent Controls](multi-agent-controls.md) then MASO |
| Open-weight / self-hosted models | Open-Weight Models |

**PACE resilience (read after controls):**
- [Control Layer Resilience](pace-controls-section.md) - PACE for each control layer
- [PACE for Agentic AI](pace-agentic-section.md) - PACE for agentic deployments
- [PACE Checklist](pace-checklist-section.md) - verify your fail postures

## The Fundamental Shift

Traditional software can be tested before deployment. AI cannot - not fully.

| Traditional Software | AI Systems |
|---------------------|------------|
| Deterministic outputs | Non-deterministic |
| Testable at design time | Emergent behavior |
| Known failure modes | Adversarial discovery |

**The shift:** From design-time assurance to runtime behavioral monitoring.

## The Pattern

The industry is converging on three layers:

| Layer | Function | Timing |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Guardrails** | Block known-bad inputs/outputs | Real-time |
| **Judge** | Detect unknown-bad via LLM evaluation | Async |
| **Human Oversight** | Decide, act, remain accountable | As needed |

**Guardrails prevent. Judge detects. Humans decide.**

### Where This Pattern Exists

This isn't theoretical. Production implementations include:

| Platform | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| [NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) | Input, dialog, retrieval, execution, output rails |
| [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/) | Middleware + human-in-the-loop |
| [Guardrails AI](https://www.guardrailsai.com/) | Open-source validator framework |
| [Galileo](https://www.rungalileo.io/) | Eval-to-guardrail lifecycle |
| [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) | Model-as-Judge evaluation |
| AWS Bedrock Guardrails | Managed filtering |
| Azure AI Content Safety | Content moderation |

**→ For detailed solution comparison, see Current Solutions**

What has been missing: clear guidance on *why* this pattern is necessary and *how* to implement it proportionate to risk, in a way that respects how each organisation actually works.

## Scope

**In:** Custom LLM apps, AI decision support, document processing, agentic systems  
**Out:** Vendor AI products, model training, data preparation

## Quick Start

### 1. Classify Your System

| Tier | Profile | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Direct decisions, customer/financial/safety impact | Credit decisions, fraud blocking |
| **HIGH** | Significant influence, sensitive data | Customer service with account access |
| **MEDIUM** | Moderate impact, human review expected | Internal Q&A, document drafting |
| **LOW** | Minimal impact, non-sensitive | Public FAQ, suggestions |

### 2. Select Controls

| Control | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL |
|---------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| Input guardrails | Basic | Standard | Enhanced | Maximum |
| Output guardrails | Basic | Standard | Enhanced | Maximum |
| Judge evaluation | - | Sampling | All | All + real-time |
| Human review | Exceptions | Sampling | Risk-based | All significant |

### 3. Implement in Order

1. **Logging** - Can't evaluate what you don't capture
2. **Basic guardrails** - Block obvious attacks  
3. **Judge in shadow mode** - Evaluate without action
4. **HITL queues** - Somewhere for findings to go
5. **Operationalise** - Act on findings, tune continuously

## Key Principles

1. **Match controls to risk** - Apply the right controls at the right time for the right purposes. Do not over-engineer low-risk systems
2. **Respect organisational context** - Every organisation has its own structures and ways of working. Select and adapt controls accordingly
3. **Guardrails are necessary but not sufficient** - They miss novel attacks and nuance
4. **Judge is assurance, not control** - It detects; humans decide what to do
5. **Infrastructure beats instructions** - Enforce technically, not via prompts
6. **Assume bypasses happen** - Design for detection, not just prevention
7. **Humans remain accountable** - AI assists; humans own outcomes
